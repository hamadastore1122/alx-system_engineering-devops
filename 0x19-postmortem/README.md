Postmortem
Learning how to write an Incident Report, also referred to as a Postmortem. This postmortem follows the guidelines used closely by google engineers to file reports. The report is made up of five parts, an issue summary, a timeline, root cause analysis, resolution and recovery, and lastly, corrective and preventative measures. Lets review each of these parts in detail.


Issue Summary
1 _ short summary (5 sentences)
2 _ list the duration along with start and end times (include timezone)
3 _ state the impact (most user requests resulted in 500 errors, at peak 100%)
4 _ close with root cause


Timeline
1 _ list the timezone
2 _ covers the outage duration
3 _ when outage began
4 _ when staff was notified
5 _ actions, events, â€¦
6 _ when service was restored



Root Cause
1 _ give a detailed explanation of event
2 _ do not sugarcoat


Resolution and recovery
1 _ give detailed explanation of actions taken (includes times)


Corrective and Preventative Measures
1 _ itemized list of ways to prevent it from happening again
2 _ what can we do better next time?
